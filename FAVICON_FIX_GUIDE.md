## Steps to Verify the Fix

### 1. Deploy Changes
Make sure all changes are deployed to your Netlify site.

### 2. Test Favicon Accessibility
Visit these URLs to ensure favicons are accessible:
- https://www.schedulix.hu/favicon.ico
- https://www.schedulix.hu/s-atmenetes.svg
- https://www.schedulix.hu/s-atmenetes.png

### 3. Submit Sitemap to Google Search Console
1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Select your property (schedulix.hu)
3. Navigate to "Sitemaps" in the left menu
4. Submit your sitemap: https://schedulix.hu/sitemap.xml

### 4. Request Indexing
1. In Google Search Console, go to "URL Inspection"
2. Enter your homepage URL: https://www.schedulix.hu/
3. Click "Request Indexing"

### 5. Clear Google's Favicon Cache
Google caches favicons which can cause delays in updates:
1. Visit this URL to check current favicon indexing:
   https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=schedulix.hu
   
2. If it's not showing the correct favicon, you can try:
   - Adding a query parameter to force refresh: 
     https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=schedulix.hu&sz=64
   - Wait for Google to naturally refresh its cache (can take weeks)

### 6. Monitor Progress
1. Check Google Search Console for any crawl errors
2. Monitor the "Coverage" report for any indexing issues
3. Use the "URL Inspection" tool to see how Google views your pages

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Add Structured Data
Consider adding more structured data to help Google understand your site better:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "Schedulix",
  "url": "https://www.schedulix.hu/",
  "description": "Online munkaidő beosztás kezelő alkalmazás",
  "applicationCategory": "BusinessApplication",
  "operatingSystem": "Web",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "0",
    "priceCurrency": "HUF"
  }
}
```

### 2. Optimize for Mobile
Ensure your site is mobile-friendly as Google uses mobile-first indexing.

### 3. Improve Page Speed
Optimize images and minimize JavaScript for better performance.

## Troubleshooting

If the favicon still doesn't appear after implementing these changes:

1. **Wait Patiently**: Google can take several weeks to update favicon caches
2. **Check for Errors**: Use Google Search Console to identify any issues
3. **Verify DNS**: Ensure your domain DNS is properly configured
4. **Check Redirects**: Make sure there are no redirect loops affecting favicon access
5. **Test with Different Sizes**: Ensure your favicon.ico contains multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48)

## Contact Support
If issues persist after trying all these steps, consider:
1. Reaching out to Netlify support for hosting-related issues
2. Consulting Google Search Console community forums
3. Verifying your site ownership in Google Search Console for more detailed insights

Remember that favicon updates in Google search results can take time, sometimes several weeks, as Google periodically refreshes its favicon cache.
