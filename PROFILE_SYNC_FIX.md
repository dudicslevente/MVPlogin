# Profile Sync Fix Documentation

## Problem
New users were experiencing an issue where their chosen username was not being properly saved in the database. Instead, a temporary username (like `user_[UUID]`) was being stored.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a race condition between:
1. The automatic profile creation trigger that creates a temporary profile with a placeholder username
2. The asynchronous JavaScript code that updates the profile with the user's chosen username

If the async update failed or timed out, the temporary username would remain in the database.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Profile Update Logic in supabase.js
- Improved error handling in the [signUpWithEmail](file:///Users/dudicslevente/MEGA/MVPlogin-intellij--qoder%20magyar/supabase.js#L13-L132) function
- Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Added fallback mechanisms if primary update approach fails
- Added localStorage flag (`scheduleManager_profile_needs_sync`) to track profiles that need updating

### 2. Delayed Profile Sync
- Added [performDelayedProfileSync()](file:///Users/dudicslevente/MEGA/MVPlogin-intellij--qoder%20magyar/supabase.js#L396-L420) function to retry profile updates
- Implemented calls to this function on:
  - App initialization ([index.html](file:///Users/dudicslevente/MEGA/MVPlogin-intellij--qoder%20magyar/index.html))
  - Profile page load ([profile.html](file:///Users/dudicslevente/MEGA/MVPlogin-intellij--qoder%20magyar/profile.html))

### 3. Periodic Profile Validation
- Added [periodicProfileCheck()](file:///Users/dudicslevente/MEGA/MVPlogin-intellij--qoder%20magyar/supabase.js#L423-L457) function that runs every 5 minutes
- This function checks if the database has a temporary username while localStorage has the real one
- Automatically fixes the discrepancy when detected

### 4. Database Improvements (Optional)
- Created [supabase_improved_trigger.sql](file:///Users/dudicslevente/MEGA/MVPlogin-intellij--qoder%20magyar/supabase_improved_trigger.sql) with enhanced trigger logic
- Added `update_user_profile` database function for more reliable profile updates

## Implementation Steps

1. The JavaScript changes are already implemented in the updated files
2. (Optional) To use the improved database trigger, run [supabase_improved_trigger.sql](file:///Users/dudicslevente/MEGA/MVPlogin-intellij--qoder%20magyar/supabase_improved_trigger.sql) in your Supabase SQL editor

## Testing the Fix

1. Create a new user account
2. Check the `profiles` table in your Supabase database to verify the correct username is stored
3. Simulate network issues during signup to verify the retry mechanism works
4. Check that the periodic validation catches and fixes any discrepancies

## Future Enhancements

1. Add more sophisticated error reporting
2. Implement push notifications for sync status
3. Add a manual sync button in the profile UI
